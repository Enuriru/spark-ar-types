# spark-ar-types
 
This repository tracks API changes in Spark AR Studio. Since it's done with a weird parsers and workarounds, could be not 100% accurate.

* Types: internal methods and properties and in-house APIs. Some of them are unavailable.
* PublicTypes: methods and properties from official docs. All should be available.
* SparkSL: available SparkSL methods and properties.

To see how API changes over time, check out commits.
Have fun!
