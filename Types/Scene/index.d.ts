```
clone(sceneObject: string | SceneObjectBase, options?: {cloneBlocksInputConnections?: false | true, cloneChildren?: false | true, initialState?: {[key: string]: any}}): Promise<SceneObjectBase>
```

Clone a scene object asynchronously.
When cloning a scene object, keep the following in mind:
- `sceneObject` is either the identifier of the SceneObjectBase or the SceneObjectBase itself to be cloned. Cloning a scene object with an identifier that doesn't exist, or one that cannot be dynamically instantiated fails the `Promise`.
- New objects always get assigned a globally unique `identifier`.
- All properties that are using Signal types get assigned a ConstSignal with the last value unless `initialState` (see below) overrides it.
- `options` include a set of optional parameters for cloning
    - `cloneChildren` - when true, recursively clone all children of the scene object in the scene tree. If any of the children is non-clonable or fails to be cloned, roll back to the previous state before cloning and return an error that specifies the childâ€™s id and type. The default is false.
    - `initialState` overrides any cloned states on `sceneObject`.
    - `initialState` can contain any `key: value` pair for any settable property of the scene object class (e.g. `hidden`, `transform`). Similar to dynamic instantiation, setting invalid fields will fail the promise.
    - `cloneBlocksInputConnections` -  Block's input connections will be cloned if this flag is set to true. The default is false. The flag is ignored if `sceneObject` is not a BlockSceneRoot. If `cloneChildren` is also set to true, this flag will be recurisvely applied to all block children.

- `initialState` can contain any `key: value` pair for any settable property of the scene object class being cloned.

projectToScreen(point: PointSignal): Vec2Signal

Returns a signal with the value that corresponds to the 2D point value (in Screen Space) of the given world coordinate.
Screen space positions are represented in the range of `(0, 0)` to `(CameraInfo.previewSize.width, CameraInfo.previewSize.height)`,
with the coordinate start being the top left point of the screen and `previewSize.width/height` being the bottom right.

The values in the returned signal are not capped to the size of the screen space and can lie outside of the visible screen area.

This functionality can be used for precisely positioning 2D screen elements or to add additional effects that apply to the entire camera texture, based on contents of the scene.
