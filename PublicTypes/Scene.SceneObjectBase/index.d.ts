 * Returns a promise that is resolved with the all occurrences of scene objects matching the path query or empty array if none was found.

 * `*` matches any characters sequence.
 * `*` as standalone component matches one level of the scene tree (i.e. any child)
 * `**` as standalone component matches any level of scene tree (will result in recursive find)
 * `/` is a path component separator
 * `\` can be used to include in component name any of the control characters (including '\' itself)
 * 
 * Examples:
 * `findByPath("*")` will match all the direct children of the caller.
 * `findByPath("* /A")` will match all grandchildren of the caller named A.
 * `findByPath("** /A")` will match all descendants of the caller named A.
 * `findByPath("A*")` will match all children of the caller which name is prefixed with 'A', like 'ABC'.
 * `findByPath("** /*A*")` will match all descendants of the caller which name contains 'A', like 'AX' and 'XA'.
 * `findByPath("** /A", {limit: 10})` will match at most first 10 descendants of the caller named A.
 * `findByPath("\\*")` will match all children of the caller named *.
 * `findByPath("\\\\")` will match all children of the caller named \.
 * 
 * `limit` parameter describes if `findByPath` should finish the search if it finds specified number of results (default is no limit). Non-positive values for limit are treated as unlimited.
 * 
 * **Note**: object D is considered to be a descendant of object P if either D is a child of P or if such an object C which is a child of P exists that D is a descendant of C.
