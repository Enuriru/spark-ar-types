the end and is not looping.

(get) progress: ScalarSignal
(set) progress: ScalarSignal
```

Specifies a 'ScalarSignal' that is representing the current progress while
playing back the GalleryTexture. Note that the progress normalized and
is in [0.0, 1.0].
Note that setting an out of bounds progress value (ie. < 0.0 or > 1.0) will
be ignored and playback continues unchanged.  This is useful because binding
this signal to values that are in range constantly will result in constant
seek attempts in the underlying Video Player that might degrade performance.
Also cf. seek() API.

Note that setting the progress signal on a paused video won't implicitly
start it.

 * Seeks video playback position to 'value' for the current media.
 * Note that the value normalized and is in [0.0, 1.0] and that this API
 * is causing a seek operation in the underlying Video Player.
 * 
 * Any signal bound to "progress" will take precedence over an explicit seek()
 * call. An error will be returned from seek() in that case.
 * 
 * Note that seeking a paused video won't implicitly start it.
